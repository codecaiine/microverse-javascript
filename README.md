# Portfolio portfolio

The project is inspired by the figma microverse template 1 (https://figma.com/)
For the fourth project in your portfolio website:

- We used media queries to make sure that the website displays correctly on desktop screens.
- We used both grid and flex box
- Checked and fixed linters errors
